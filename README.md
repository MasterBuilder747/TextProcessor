# Modular Machinery Machine recipe generator

This is a great program to use if you need a ton of modular machine recipes and you don't have the time to write them all, this program will do that for you.

How to use:
1. Download this project
2. Open it in a Java IDE (eg. Eclipse, IntellJ, Netbeans, etc)
3. In the code: change the String for the file path to (preferably) your desktop [TODO: I will make a UI for this instead]
4. In the code: change the variable generated to work for your machine (multiple machines can be added as well) [UI for this too]
5. Create a new blank text file name recipes.txt (or whatever name you put in the directory String)
6. Go into your pack and grab the items into your inventory, 
  make sure that the input is the first item on the left (on your hotbar), that <minecraft:log> is in your offhand
7. Run /ct inventory
8. View your log file and copy and paste the generated items (including the stacks) into your blank file in your defined path
9. Run the program (ignore the null pointer exception, it still works)
10. Copy the code that is printed in the IDE's terminal [TODO: output a file instead of sout]
11. There is your MM recipes!
